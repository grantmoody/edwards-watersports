                    <h1>Ethan Edwards</h1>
                    <h5>Hi, I'm Ethan Edwards, the CEO/Founder of Edwards Watersports. When I was 16 years old, I had a simple idea to start renting out jet skis to people on the lake near my home. I had always been passionate about water sports, and I figured there was a demand for jet ski rentals in my area. I started small, with just a few used jet skis and I would rent them out on the weekends and gradually reinvested the profits back into the business. 
                        <br><br>
                        Starting a business at such a young age wasn't easy. I had to learn about the legal and regulatory aspects of entrepreneurship, as well as marketing and customer service. But I was determined to make my vision a reality, and I wasn't afraid to work hard and learn from my mistakes.
                        <br><br>
                        As word of mouth spread, my business grew quickly. People loved renting our jet skis and experiencing the thrill of riding on the water. I was proud of what I had accomplished, and I knew that I wanted to continue running my business for years to come.
                        Today, I'm still working hard towards my goals and each day I continue to strive to do better than the last. And I encourage other young people to pursue their passions and take risks, even if they seem unconventional. - Ethan Edwards </h5>
